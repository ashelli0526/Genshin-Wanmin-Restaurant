         <img src="img/black-back-perch.png" alt="Picture of Black Back Perch Stew">
         <h3>Black Back Perch Stew</h3>
         <p>A poached fish dish. The fresh and tasty fish fillets are tender and juicy. The secret to this recipe is adding powdered Violetgrass into the heated oil to give the dish that aromatic scent. It's spicy, but not too spicy.</p>

         <img src="img/come-and-get-it.png" alt="Picture of Come and Get it">
         <h3>Come and Get it</h3>
         <p>A dish made out of a luxurious variety of ingredients. There is no great refinement in the making of this food, and it appears in Liyue often during festival season. Whenever this dish is served up, the person at the head of the table will invite everyone to dig in, saying "Come on, eat, eat," hence the name.</p>

         <h3>Crab Roe Tofu</h3>
         <p>A dish with a tender mouthfeel. Crab roe is stir-fried till the oil within oozes out before being added to boiled tofu and accented with broth. Simple, yes, but gloriously fresh.</p>

         <h3>Crystal Shrimp</h3>
         <p>One of Liyue's traditional snacks. The stuffing is taken from whole fresh shrimp, and the glistening quality of the flour can be guessed at from the translucence of the outer skin. Has a springy, tasty chew.</p>

         <img src="img/dragon-beard-noodles.png" alt="Picture of Dragon Beard Noodles">
         <h3>Dragon Beard Noodles</h3>
         <p>Noodles that are as slender as the hairs on a dragon's beard. The green onion is fried in a wok before the soup and condiments are added. Last in are the noodles, after which the lot is ladled out and plated up. The noodles must be skillfully hand-pulled multiple times before they become extremely thin — a technique that makes this dish the most challenging noodle recipe in Liyue.</p>

         <img src="img/grilled-tiger-fish.png" alt="Picture of Grilled Tiger Fish">
         <h3>Grilled Tiger Fish</h3>
         <p>A fish kebab grilled over an open flame. The fish is a fresh catch straight from the harbor, lightly picked and swiftly grilled. Its aroma attracts the street cats. Indeed, freshness is the secret of flavor.</p>

         <h3>Jueyun Chili Chicken</h3>
         <p>Cold chicken mixed in dressings. The finesse technique used in mixing the dish retained the freshness of the delightful juice contained within the chicken. The glowing gold chicken skin hides a mildly hot flavor underneath.</p>

         <img src="img/mint-salad.png" alt="Picture of Mint Salad">
         <h3>Mint Salad</h3>
         <p>A fragrant salad dish. Finely chopped Jueyun Chilis blended with a sauce and mixed with Mint leaves. It looks like nothing special, but it has surprisingly potent powers of refreshment and reinvigoration. It is also the perfect palate-cleanser after a greasy, indulgent meal.</p>
         <hr>
         <img src="img/minty-meat-rolls.png" alt="Picture of Minty Meat Rolls">
         <h3>Minty Meat Rolls</h3>
         <p>A sour-and-spicy dish. The marinated meat has been thinly sliced and rolled into the mint leaves, before being brushed with a sauce blend containing Jueyun Chilis. The unique mint flavor adds the finishing touch to this dish, turning it into an excellent addition to any cold platter.</p>

         <img src="img/rice-buns.png" alt="Picture of Rice Buns">
         <h3>Rice Buns</h3>
         <p>Soft and fluffy food. The rice and horsetail have been ground into flour and kneaded into dough before being put in a steaming basket. It can be eaten as-is or with vegetable stuffing. Portable and filling, it is a very popular dish in the Liyue region.</p>

         <img src="img/squirrel-fish.png" alt="Picture of Squirrel Fish">
         <h3>Squirrel Fish</h3>
         <p>A hard-to-prepare fish dish. The fish is first completely deboned before crisscross cuts are made on the skin. The fish is then coated in flour and deep-fried to a golden-brown color, then served with ketchup drizzled on top. It is tender and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The dish resembles a squirrel's tail to a certain degree, hence the name.</p>

         <img src="img/triple-consumme.png" alt="Picture of Triple Layered Consumme">
         <h3>Triple Layered Consumme</h3>
         <p>A neatly arranged dish. The ham, fowl, and bamboo shoots have been sliced into threads of equal length, and they've been laid out neatly in the soup bowl after being steamed at high heat, before being covered in consommé. The layers are distinct, and the mouthfeel is salty yet fresh.</p>

         <img src="img/universal-peace.png" alt="Picture of Universal Peace">
         <h3>Universal Peace</h3>
         <p>Colorful staple food. Maintains perfect balance between soft and fragrant rice and all kinds of carefully selected sweet ingredients. This dish is mainly known for its meaning as a symbol of prosperity and peace, and less so for its taste. However, with such noble ideals behind it, its flavor should not disappoint.</p>
